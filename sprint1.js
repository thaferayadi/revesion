//Compiled languages are translated into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance. 
// Interpreted languages are executed line by line, with code translated at runtime, 
//  making them more flexible but potentially slower. 
  // Some languages, like Java, use a combination of both, employing a bytecode compilation step for portability.
  //High-level languages provide abstraction from hardware details, enabling easier code development compared to low-level languages. They are more human-readable and portable across different platforms.


//Weakly typed languages allow flexibility with variable types, often leading to implicit type conversions, which can result in unexpected behavior.
//v8 is an open source javascript engine develloped by google.b8 is responsible for excuting code javascript into ther browser.


//An engine is a software component that executes tasks or processes, often associated with interpreting or processing specific types of data or instructions.


//JavaScript is a widely-used, high-level, interpreted programming language primarily known for its role in web development, enabling dynamic and interactive content on websites. 

//JavaScript is chosen for its versatility, as it runs in web browsers, allowing for dynamic and interactive web pages.
// Its ease of learning, large developer community,
 //and cross-platform compatibility contribute to its widespread adoption.


//A functional-based language emphasizes a functional programming paradigm, treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and promoting immutability and higher-order functions for expressive and concise code.

//An object-oriented language organizes code around objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. It promotes concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to structure and model software systems.
